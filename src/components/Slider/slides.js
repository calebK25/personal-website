    slideDescription:
      "I am a Computer Science student at Princeton University with minors in Statistics & Machine Learning and Quantitative Economics. I am currently interested in hallucination and reasoning in LLMs and VLMs, with an emphasis on how representational drift, memory consolidation, and semantic distortion arise in artificial systems. More specifically why models fabricate knowledge, how reasoning errors emerge, and what interventions, via training dynamics, curriculum design, or interpretability methods, can mitigate these failures.",
