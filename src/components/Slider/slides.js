    slideDescription:
    "I’m a Computer Science major at Princeton University with minors in Statistics & Machine Learning. I’m especially interested in vision–language models. In regards to the current landscape of AI, I believe the frontier won’t be moved by compute alone, but by smarter training signals and mechanistic interpretability to understand and fix hallucinations. I currently conduct research in both the Princeton Vision & Learning Lab and the Princeton IPA Lab. Outside of academics, I’m into powerlifting and photography and I love listening to new music.",

    slideTitle: "Experience",
    slideDescription:
      "My research asks how to make models both see and remember reliably. In 3D vision, I study how to estimate and exploit the temporal dynamics of camera intrinsics (zoom, focus) directly from raw video, disentangling lens changes from scene motion and training systems that stay robust under real-world optics. In language, I investigate the mechanisms behind hallucination using DRM-style false-memory probes to pinpoint when and why LLMs hallucinate.",
